/**
 * An OutputStream which replaces the specified file when closing the stream
 * <p>
 * The basic idea of this OutputStream is that when the stream is being fully
 * written and closed, the backing file will simply be swapped out. This should
 * ensure that only a completely written file will be able to replace the
 * original file.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link #commit()} method needs to be called before calling close,
 * otherwise the file will not be overwritten with the new content, but the new
 * content will be discarded.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This implementation redirects all output to a file beside the original file
 * and atomically replaces the target file in the {@link #close()} method if the
 * {@link #commit()} method was called at least once before.
 * </p>
