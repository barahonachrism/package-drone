/**
 * The service for working with channels
 * <h2>Channel access</h2>
 * <p>
 * Accessing a channel is primarily done by using the
 * {@link #accessRun(By, Class, ChannelOperationVoid)} and
 * {@link #accessCall(By, Class, ChannelOperation)} methods. Each of those
 * methods access an interface class and operation. The interface class chooses
 * in which way the channel will be accessed (e.g. read-only, writing,
 * configuration). Not all channels must support all operations. The operation
 * receives an instance of the requested interface class and may perform
 * operations on this instance as long as the operation method does not return.
 * After the operation is completed the instance will be disposed can further
 * calls to this instance will cause exceptions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Supported interface classes are:
 * </p>
 * <dl>
 * <dt>{@link ReadableChannel}</dt>
 * <dd>A read only instance to the channel. Will lock the channel in shared read
 * mode. No write access is possible.</dd>
 * <dt>{@link ModifiableChannel}</dt>
 * <dd>A modifiable instance to the channel. Will lock the channel in exclusive
 * mode. No other read or write access is possible. Modifications will not be
 * persisted when the operation returns with an exception.
 * <dt>{@link DescriptorAdapter}</dt>
 * <dd>An instance for accessing the id and name mapping of the channel. Won't
 * lock the channel itself.</dd>
 * <dt>{@link DeployKeysChannelAdapter}</dt>
 * <dd>An instance for managing the deploy keys of a channel. Won't lock the
 * channel itself.</dt>
 * </dl>
